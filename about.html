    Normal Archive examines what is considered “normal” in our society and what that idea excludes. Rather than treating normality as neutral or universal, it approaches “normal” as a socially constructed set of standards. Through open-ended questions and collective responses, the project invites participants to reflect on how they understand, experience, or resist what is labeled as normal. This survey surfaces overlooked details within the idea of “normal” while building a shared archive that questions who defines it.
